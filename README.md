## Example Chat
User:   Hi, let's create a reservation!

Agent:  Okay, let's get started. First, can you tell me which hotel you'd like to stay at?

User:   What options do you have?

Agent:  We have three hotels: Seaside Resort in Miami Beach, FL, Mountain View Lodge in Aspen, CO, and Urban Stay Central in Chicago, IL.

        Seaside Resort offers amenities like a pool, free WiFi, a gym, and beach access. Mountain View Lodge has a spa, free breakfast, a ski shuttle, and rooms with fireplaces. Urban Stay Central features a conference room, is pet-friendly, and has a fitness center and valet parking.

        Which hotel are you interested in?

User:   A beach is the most important!

Agent:  Okay, that sounds like the Seaside Resort in Miami Beach would be a great fit.

        To check availability, what are your preferred check-in and check-out dates, and how many guests will be staying?
